Sidmouth Folk Week! My spiritual home and destroyer of any actual non-Sidmouth plans. This was a fairly emotional one, being my first time not doing it with Shooting Roots in many many years... but instead doing the festival with the excellent choir/band-of-wonderful-madpeople that is Stream of Sound. Any of you who've been following my stuff might have noticed I've been working with them for a few years now as their designer but this year they finally managed to long-game me into the choir itself, teaching and performing with them. It's been fantastic. We had to leave early because of some extreme weather, but it was still a very excellent time spent with absolutely lovely people, working hard and having a lot of fun while doing it. I also made sure to do what I could to stay very present and appreciate things around me, so there was a lot less taking photos, checking the internet and so on... which was pretty refreshing and it's interesting coming back to the desk and big pile of tech.

## Next week then...
Now that I'm back home I can start to get re-centred on most of my goals here. There's a big chunk of sleep dep and self care to catch up on but keeping busy is a good offset for festival comedown. I'm pretty excited to channel the energy and positivity around music that the last few weeks have built. Sidmouth generally functions as a much stronger self-check than new years does for me, so while I'm rather knackered it has lit a bit of a fire, with a couple of added accountability buddies set up in a couple of areas and a general sense that it's time to make time for the things I want to happen.

We're almost half way through, I am feeling fairly messy but I always knew this would be deeply imperfect.

Hope your plans are going well.
