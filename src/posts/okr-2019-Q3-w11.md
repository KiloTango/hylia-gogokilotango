A fairly mad one this week, as my last week at home for the quarter. This one was fairly heavily dominated by working on the [new Mantradeva video](https://youtu.be/9Cf17drOmeQ), which was a lot of work but very satisfying. It also became very apparent how wiped out I'd gotten and how needed some down time actually is...

## Next week then...
As I'm on holiday for the rest of the quarter, I figure very little progress will get made on any of these (though you never know). Taking time to rest, reflect and consider where I want to point myself when I come back to work...

Look after yourself and have a good time with whatever you're up to this week.
