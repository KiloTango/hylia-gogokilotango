## How did it go?
New starts alway bring a whole heap of energy with them, so this went pretty solidly. I was surprised how much housework I ended up doing, and how much I ended up wanting to keep my inbox clear. My attempt at a shifted daily routine has been surprisingly effective, particularly banning my iPad from my bed: sleep and particularly getting up in the mornings has been a lot easier.

## Did you do the things?
- Upskilling: Yep. A lot of reading, listening to podcasts and conference talks. I started a list of areas I want to learn more about specifically as well.
- Practice & Writing: Yeah. Could have done more but did some code and then there's the writing up of this post
- Music: Yes. No instruments but lots of recording, including finishing a track.
- Tidying, filing, email: Yep, kept on top of my inbox but also did a lot of housework and tackled some stuff I've been meaning to for a while.
- Personal work: Yes. Spent an hour exploring Eleventy for how I could build myself a new personal site.

## What did you read/watch/listen to?
Not going to include everything but here's a few links:
- Quite a lot of episodes of [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/), covering topics from habit building, developing mobile and desktop apps on the same codebase, feature & release planning, how they would approach building something like AirB&B, and habits of effective developers.
- [Some very nice examples of focus styles](https://zellwk.com/blog/creating-focus-style/)
- [Jane Austin - 10 Easy Ways to Irritate Your Design Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygZxkNZxn3U) from NUX7
- Various Andy Bell articles on stuff like [really embracing the spirit of Progressive Enhancement](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/the-p-in-progressive-enhancement-stands-for-pragmatism/), [burnout](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/burnout/) and [recovery](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/burnout-a-long-recovery/)
- Finished reading [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
- [Harry Brewis's XOXO talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS1k88LzjkQ) which greatly restores my faith in humanity.

## What did you learn?
First off, that I should start collecting more detailed notes earlier, but I'll start applying that this week. Some quick points:

- If you're going to remove the default glowy focus styles, you need to put something back. Your options are borders, colours, background and movement (and you probably shouldn't rely on just movement).
- You can make interesting multi-layered borders that don't effect layout by using multiple box-shadows.
- Progressive enhancement does not mean make the thing look the same but with more annoying code on older browsers. Make the simple look good and people won't know they're missing things.

A recurring theme this week was the importance of empathy, understanding, curiosity and enthusiasm, and I feel these things apply whatever field you're working in. When you boil them down 11 habits Wes and Scott give in Syntax come down to this. You get good by nurturing both yourself and those around you, growing by listening to the experiences of others and honing what you know by passing on your own in turn. And this kind of generosity of knowledge and attention is part of building the kind of culture that isn't going to send your designers (and the rest of your team) insane too. This is a principle I've tried to hold for a while but it's nice to have it stated in harder terms as well: kindness isn't just a fluffy kind of good, it helps us bring our best selves to the table in our work as well. It drives the web forward and it makes sure we're building and designing stuff fit for the world, instead of just for the room we spend the most time in.

## Next week then?
I know this one is going to be a little harder as I've got guests and gigs to attend and a lot of work to get done, but I'm going to try and approach it pretty much the same way I did this week as that worked well. That said I think I need to start writing up what I've learned on a more daily basis so I've got more to draw on though as a lot kind of blurred together by the time it came to writing this.

One last thing, I've also been listening to a lot of [The Anthropocene Reviewed](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed) this week, wherein John Green apprises assorted random elements of the human centred world on a five star scale. Fascinating, heartbreaking and heartwarming in equal measure. I'll be listening to more of that this week as well.

Good look with whatever you're up to this week.
