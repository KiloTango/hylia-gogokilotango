Okay, so while I did set things up in a way I'd be able update this while I was away, I found myself making the most of the abysmal phone reception and precarious tech charging situation that is festival time to stay in the moment and not faff about with the internet too much. Consequently doing this maybe fell off a cliff, so batch writing the last 2 weeks for you.

This week was a whole lot of rehearsals and then the start of Sidmouth Folk Week, my favourite week of the year, this time spent with the wonderful choir Stream of Sound.

## Next week then...
As I'm writing this the Sunday _after_, there's not a lot to say here, other than knowing the full week of Sidmouth proper is would disrupt things even more...
