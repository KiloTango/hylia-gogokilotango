About this time last year, I was introduced to the idea of OKRs as part of a currently ironically in-stasis project around goal-setting and learning, and I've been experimenting with doing personal OKRs each quarter since. It being a year or so makes this a great time to take a step back and reflect on how that worked out, and how I want to approach goal setting in the future. I've learnt a lot across the last 12 months, both about how I work in general, what I need to do to support myself on a self care front, and how I organise my time.

## Ok cool but what even is an OKR?
In short, a specific, aspirational way of goal setting used to keep yourself accountable. It is usually used in teams, and is made of _Objectives_ (What you want to achieve) and _Key Results_ (What would success look like). These should all be measurable things, and where it gets interesting is you set goals that you feel you will only hit around 70% of, making them both something to push yourself outside your comfort zone while also giving you a bit of licence to screw it up because you are not expected to hit them with perfection. You can read a bit more about how I've been tackling in my [Q3 OKR post](https://gogokilotango.co.uk/posts/okr-a-rama-2019q3/) I started this blog with.

## So how did that go?
So first up, I know I strayed increasingly far from how you're supposed to do things. A lot of my KRs ended up becoming more like to do lists, and I shifted from specific dates to more interval based timing. So I wouldn't take what I've learnt as an assessment of OKRs as a system because I know I've not been setting them perfectly. As someone who struggles with mental health stuff, I think my experience will be different from a lot of people, but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person fighting that fight so figured I should keep sharing. Anyway, here's what I noticed:

### 70% of infinity is still infinity
In other words, if you set goals that are way too far beyond your capacity, a sense of futility easily creeps in as even getting 70% of the way can be too unobtainable. As someone juggling a salary gig with freelancing while fighting mental health stuff and who helpfully both suffers from SAD _and_ often ends up with an intensely scattered summer due to folk festival season, one big learning this year was I habitually massively over-reach. Every set of OKRs I did had a depressing handful of abandoned tasks that had become impossible and that flips the aspirational nature of OKRs into a reminder of the stuff you're failing to do. That was compounded by typing those things out in my accountability posts here. There's some things where you need a kick up the arse to get yourself to do the things you're dropping, but a continual kicking can drift into effectively bullying, and that's not too far removed from repeatedly stamping on those flowerbeds you're planting.

### "A point in every direction is the same as no point at all"
To quote Harry Nilsson's _'The Point'_ (The film of which is handily just about to get an [anniversary re-release!](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/harry-nilsson-the-point-50th-anniversary-893972/)). I'm a sucker for wanting to do _all the things_ and that meant not only were some of my OKRs way too much, there was an absolute sea of them. That just made the problem worse and contributed heavily to the overwhelm that dragged down my motivation and morale.

### Sometimes rubber works better than glass
By far the most successful things for me were the KRs that were time-limited or interval-based, but flexible. Things like taking an hour of study time a week were inspiring to do, attainable, and actually felt like they gave me the best long-term results as well. Some of this I think is because they were always something I could effectively start over at any point if I dropped. The ones in this format where that didn't work for me I think failed out of being overwhelmed by how many things I'd set or how big they were. Being able to fall off the wagon without the wagon driving off a cliff before you can catch up to it is important.

### Tasks without regular check-ins don't happen
While my first set of OKRs _were_ full of deadlines, because I over-reached they were mostly missed. Tasks that did have an 'x times a month' were far less likely to happen than the ones what were 'x times a week', and the ones that were just 'do this thing' generally didn't happen at all. Being able to have either small and regular tasks or incremental progress checks really helps keep up motivation.

### Not all the structure worked for me
I've found writing these weekly check-ins really helpful, even though with the abandoned tasks it became a slog and I'm sure less interesting to read because of it. But a whole bunch of my tasks really didn't lend themselves well to weekly metrics. On top of that, I just wasn't able to go from one quarter straight into another very well, which is why this is late. And on that point...

### Thirteen is not a lucky number
I really like the idea of working in quarters, but while stressing out about not being prepared for this quarter I realised that actually, it is really useful to have a week without the pressure of trying to hit your stuff, and to step back and reflect on what you need to do next. Even just from a practical standpoint with Q4, the last week of the year is not usually a very peaceful one. This stuff is defining your path for the next three months, it makes sense to give yourself the headspace to deal with it properly.

## So what are you going to do with that?
I'm reassessing how I approach these things to the point they don't really count as OKRs.

First off, I decided to intentionally take this week as a reset week and really hone in on what I wanted to do with the rest of my year. Twelve works better than thirteen for me.

On top of the stuff I learnt about how OKRs were and weren't working for me, I also noticed myself getting very close to burnout and as Q4 is usually one of the hardest for me in terms of dealing with SAD (not to mention the entire current news cycle), I decided to pull things back, lower the pressure a little and cut down how many goals I made. I'm also dropping the list of 'little things' that I've been using as it just wasn't being used and was becoming another thing to beat myself up with.

If I was going to put a singular focus on this, I guess it would be something like **'Craft a stable routine that helps me to keep growing.'**

In my bullet journal I use increasingly granular overviews of things and I thought that might serve me well here. I've switched to a 12 week cycle (plus a week of downtime) because it divides much more cleanly than 13 does while also allowing for a planning/reset week. I noticed myself dropping some of the stuff I've been learning so decided that I'd use this blog to help me cement some of it by writing about it, hopefully giving the check ins something more interesting to read—and to write—in the process. I also decided to try and start building a better daily routine, that I won't be tracking metrics on and don't think I need to log here week by week, but might post updates on how it evolves. The daily stuff will feed into the weekly which will feed into the monthly ones.

As the '1 hour of study/upskilling a week' KR worked best for me, I decided to model my weekly habits on that. The hours can be in one go or broken into little bits as it can be easier to find smaller chunks of time, and there being a set time means I can schedule them which makes them more likely to happen. I've still made these things I feel like I'm able to hit the 70% on, but have tried to be a little more reasonable this time.  This way of doing weekly stuff will be breaking some of the ideas of 'SMART' (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound) goals as it's literally 'put in some time around this area', and that's pretty but the monthly ones cover that a bit more and I can be more specific on a week by week basis.

I've also given myself permission to edit these goals as I go if I discover them to be entirely unreasonable, which I'll evaluate every 4 weeks along with the 'monthly' goals.

## So what did you end up with?

### Monthly/Every 4 weeks:
- **Release 3 things**: These can be songs, non-check-in bits of writing, drawings, projects... anything creative really.
- **Learn 3 new tunes/songs/chord sequences**: I've got a few collaboration ideas that will help with this, but I really want to build more repetoir.
- **Do something nice for yourself**: It's fluffy and it might seem angsty I've put this here, but sometimes I need that reminder to just take some me time because it is one of the easiest things to let slip.

### Weekly
- **1 hour of study/upskilling a week**: Much like I did last quarter, I want to keep that up, but this time make sure I don't lose the things I learn, which I'm going to do via...
- **1 hour of practice or writing on what I've learnt**: That gives me stuff to write here, I'd also like to start using codepen or making small practice projects.
- **1 hour of some kind of music practice/recording/social playing**: This can be instrumental, composition or vocal.
- **1 hour of filing/email/basic tidying**: I'm garbage at keeping on top of this and that needs to change, but the inbox zero/house reset KR really helped me last time.
- **1 hour of personal work**: I was rubbish at this last time but I think it's important. I'm going to keep it a little flexible about what that actually means as I figure it out, but I feel like having to fill the time might work better for me than a list of things to not get around to doing.

### Daily Habits & Shifts v1
- 5-10 minutes of email on either side of your working day.
- 5-30 minutes of tidying each day you're at home.
- 5-10 minutes journaling/planning first thing in the morning and/or last thing at night.
- Set up tomorrow morning before you go to bed.
- Read or use podcasts instead of video before going to sleep.

## Alright then...

So let's see how this set works out. I'm hoping this will give me a bit of breathing room, while also turning some of the things I'm using to track my goals into _ways of actually doing them_ instead of being yet another thing on the to-do list.

Good luck with your own goals if you're setting some.
