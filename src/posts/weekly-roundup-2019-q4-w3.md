## How did it go?

A rough one this time. A cocktail of deadlines, stressful scheduling shenanigans, multiple day meetings at the other end of the country, &#8902;*the news*&#8902; and oncoming winter as an SAD sufferer kind of knocked me for six. This is a time of year I always need to figure out how to balance the desire to do all the things to keep my spirits ip (and keep up with my obligations) with actually making sure I get enough down time and recharging to handle the effects of the drop in light levels. The lead-in to the clocks changing always comes with a lot of trepidation as it's usually a pretty sharp point of things starting to get more difficult, but I'm trying to take that as a reminder to be a bit more forgiving to myself. So while I didn't manage to do quite as much as I'd like, I'm pretty proud that I did actually make myself take some complete downtime when I felt myself hit my limits instead of just powering through or trying to cram in more stuff.

## Did you do the things?
- Upskilling: Not quite as much as usual but still a few things.
- Practice & Writing: Just my post of this last week and some notes really.
- Music: A decent amount of recording considering how short on time I was.
- Tidying, filing, email: I was away a lot so wasn't as on top of this as much as I'd like. I've noticed I have a lot more trouble keeping up with my journaling when I'm away as well, so need to find ways to handle that a bit.
- Personal work: Frustratingly this one did go out the window a little bit, but as I was away a lot and had some very fiddly deadlines that's understandable.

## What did you read/watch/listen to? What did you learn?

- [HTML Hell](https://www.htmhell.dev/).
 	- This had only just gone up when I checked it out, but a collection of horrible HTML anti-patterns. Mostly a display of people's inability to just use a button properly, in many different and horrible ways.
- [Heydon Pickering: Web Accessibility Is Out To Get You And Make You Feel Sad](http://www.heydonworks.com/article/web-accessibility-is-out-to-get-you-and-make-you-feel-sad).
	- I don't think I can or should actually summarise this other than saying Heydon is great and has to deal with a lot of nonsense.
- Lindy Musicality with Sarah Spoon and Matt Lane (no link because it was an in person workshop)
  - It might not be my job but I like thinking about what I've learnt in dancing as well. Spoon is amazing and they bought a really great energy to the class (Matt is great too but I am taught by him almost every week and he took much more of a back seat in this one). Lots of nice little elements to this workshop, with a lot of it around playing about with the rhythms in your footwork. I've been thinking a lot about the idea of 'modularity' in dancing (oh hey, dance and code crossover), how breaking out of big monolithic moves and thinking of them as smaller components that can be strung together gives you scope to make up new things, modify stuff you already know, and get yourself out of a mess if you end up somewhere you didn't intend. A lot of the rhythmic building blocks we were given worked very well for that, as lots of moves will survive you changing the footwork rhythm as long as you honour the shape.
  - Slowing down and pausing can be incredibly effective and it's fascinating how hard it can be. That applies outside of dance as well I think.
  - We used singing/scatting to help think about dynamics and rhythm, which made me appreciate I take that stuff for granted sometimes (I'm one of those people who sings along with what she's dancing to *accidentally* sometimes). Also it turns out effectively controlling someone's singing via solo jazz Falling Off The Log is probably the most I've actually enjoyed conducting something. I feel like I should be able to use that knowledge somehow when teaching songs...
- [Tammy Everts: Um, its about your JavaScript...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31WieWrYPqc)
  - A pretty technical talk about web performance that I think I need to watch again when less run down.
  - Biggest takeaways are that it's not just the balooning size of our js that's a problem, but how much it effects CPU, especially on smaller devices.
  - It's not just our own JS either, our third party scripts can bring in more stuff and spider off horrifyingly.
  - As well as download time and blocking JS, you want to be measuring time to first idle, and time till interactive.
  - Performance budgets are meaningful again and we're in a much better positioning tooling wise to calculate them. Be reasonable about them rather than slamming in going for tiny right away, but your users will thank you for it if you can get things under control.
- [Zach Leatherman: Own your content on Social Media using the IndieWeb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3SrZuH00GQ)
  - Zach created Eleventy and is another member of the side of the web about getting stuff really fast and performant while also easy to use, accessible and ethical (while also occasionally being very silly). This talk had a lot about the problems with relying too much on social networks for hosting our content: They might be providing the server space for for us but it makes us beholden to them, and anyone who might by them. You don't have to look far to see social networks and content sites that have been ruined by changes in how they run, adding more and more advertising, changing to much more obtrusive monetization models or even just falling off the internet entirely.
  - Keeping control of our own urls is really important and these are being eroded by things like AMP, QR Codes and browser UI obfuscating them.
  - The best way of keeping control is via using 'POSSE' - Post to your Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere. If you can't do that, then 'PESOS' - Post Elsewhere and Syndicate to your Own Site. Either way, keep a copy you control somewhere.
  - Zach goes through the process he went through to make an archive of his own tweets, which is very cool and remarkably simple on Eleventy and Netlify, and also gave him a great chance to analyse and audit his own tweets, letting him see some of his biases so he could work on correcting them.

A lot of my learning this week was a little more meta, getting a better sense of my limits and what things are important to me in how I work and how people work with me. Recognising your patterns and how they can trip you up&mdash;and how they can help you&mdash;is really important. I know I have a tendency to try to go a bit over-capacity in ways that work great for a couple of weeks until I've realised I've left myself at the bottom of an energy pit. I want to make efforts to make things a little bit more maintainable as the time lost recovering kinda of cancels out the good stuff I manage while I'm being super productive.

## Next week then?

Get back on the wagon. I had some external work cancelled and want to make good use of the time I get back from that, but in a sane and nourishing way. I've noticed my 'Do nice things for yourself' quad-weekly (Is that a thing? It's a thing now) goal is a bit neglected too, so I'm going to try and make some movement on that.

Are you doing anything nice for yourself this week? Even if it's just something little, you deserve to give yourself a bit of kindness as well.
