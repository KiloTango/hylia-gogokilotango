## So how did it go?
We all make a big deal about the new year being a brand new start when really, we're still in the same run down, winter battered place we were when when we dragged ourselves over the finish line of last year. Intention does not always entail capacity.

Which is an overelaborate way of saying I was a little bit rubbish this week but I'm not going to beat myself up about it too much. It has reminded me how useful some of the tracking I've been doing has been though, as knowing that potentially that's some of the roughest days of the year already out of the way until December. But there's still been quite a lot done even in the face of that, and I had a very lovely weekend where I got to go to a stepping session run by the [Instep Research Team](https://insteprt.co.uk/) and then went to my first [Apple Wassail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Wassail) as a tradition of that has recently sprung up with a new orchard back in my parents' neck of the woods. There's nothing like some some nice communal music to make things feel better.

## Did you do the things?
- **Upskilling:** Not as much as I'd have liked but actually, as much as I'd said I'd do, I'd been way overshooting this goal a lot last year.
- **Practice & Writing:** Very little of this.
- **Music:** More of this than expected. I ended up writing another round, and I played quite a bit in sessions at the weekend.
- **Tidying, filing, email:** Eventually some. I did manage to get to inbox zero, which is something, and kept reasonably on top of most of the house. The filepocalypse is incoming though.
- **Personal work:** Very little unless I count the songwriting.
- **Exercise:** I've not started back on my training yet and probably won't this month, but I did Jazzuary on a lot of the days, went to Swingout, did some Stepping in the session and walked to and from to Wassail so actually didn't do too badly there.  

## What did you read/watch/listen to? What did you learn?
This week's was pretty light. A couple of episodes of [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) on node modules and pika pkg, both of which are a little outside my wheelhouse but interesting. And I also read the [GFDA book (warning, extremely sweary)](https://goodfuckingdesignadvice.com/#/advice/255), which is 50% an account of their highly turbulent rise to unexpected success, and 50% very blunt pep talks, all presented in a very elegantly designed package. It's a gorgeous little book and while I think it's important to also consider things like rest and not imploding into a pile of charred wreckage, there's some powerful advice in there and I've always been fond of their style.

On a less non-fiction note I also watched the first episode of [Keep Your Hands of Eizouken!!](https://www.crunchyroll.com/en-gb/keep-your-hands-off-eizouken) which is a gorgeous little show and well worth a watch if you're interested in art or animation at all. I can't think of anything that quite captures the childhood joy in drawing in the way it does.

## This week then?

Things are still a bit on the wiped out end, so I'm taking it steady, but this is also my only week this month without guests or travel so need to make the most of it. It is going to entail a lot of recording, and a traditional taxmageddon panic weekend. But also hopefully some catching up on sleep.

I hope the new year is treating you well, and if it's not, that you've at least found some good stuff to hang on to in the storm.
