## How did it go?

This was a week of half taking it steady, and half having a very inspiring and encouraging time with friends (and maybe not a great deal of work in the process). As part of my remit this quarter was to take things steady and do what I need to look after myself, considering how utterly wrecked I was by the end of last week I'm not too guilty I didn't do so much this week. A workshop I should have been doing was cancelled but I decided to use the time to catch up on some project work and also do some nice stuff for myself, which was really needed by that point. It was the first week with the clocks having changed as well, which always effects me.

## Did you do the things?
- **Upskilling:** Barely, my brain was pretty fried but I did read and listen to a couple of things.
- **Practice & Writing:** Only my round up post, to be honest. But that did take a fair bit of time.
- **Music:** This one a did. Lots of recording, an all-day Shapenote sing and some rehearsing with the excellent [@MackellarCallum](https://twitter.com/MackellarCallum).
- **Tidying, filing, email:** Just about, but slipped a good bit.
- **Personal work:** In an entirely predictable fashion for anyone who's been following me, this fell by the wayside this week.

# Hey it's been 4 weeks, what about those other things?

- **Release 3 things:** Smashed this one. While the full versions aren't available yet, across the last 4 weeks there's been 3 tracks for Mantradeva that I've sung on. There's also some album art that went to the printers in that time as well.
- **Learn 3 new tunes/songs/chord sequences:** This was rather less successful if I don't count my Harmonicblend work—which I don't think I should—as that pretty much ate all my music time across the last four weeks. This should let up a bit after this week though so I'll have time to learn some new things.
- **Do something nice for yourself:** There's been a few little things like getting myself some [really good tea](https://birdandblendtea.com/uk_en/baby-spice.html), candles, big floofy slipper socks etc. But also I finally got myself a sports massage (I need to do some more of that because oh boy am I a bit of a mess).

So, not too bad. The repertoire stuff does need a bit more intentionality applying to it, but I'm pretty confident that will come.

## What did you read/watch/listen to? What did you learn?

- [Shoptalk Show: Miriam Suzanne on Sass and CSS](https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/384/).
 	- This one touched on a lot of different areas and I should probably listen to it again.
  - Design tokens are useful for organisation and not just in multi-app systems. It makes sense to _start_ them in your sass as sass can actually consume numbers etc in ways you can't do so well in json/yaml/whatever, and use something to pull them out to be passed around to your other things that might use them.
  - While there's a lot of stuff like CSS variables that can replace some of Sass' functionality, Sass still isn't really going anywhere even if some libraries—like Miriam's own Susy—are less needed.
  - The challenge of unused CSS is a tricky one, especially if any interaction is involved, and while there's some tools to try and find them things are still a bit clunky
  - Clamp, Min and Max are starting to hit browsers and that's pretty exciting. I need to check out Clamp.
  - CSS is always a compromise between user needs, browser default and author intent.
  - Subgrid is coming! And on that note...
- [Smashing Magazine: CSS Grid Level 2: Here Comes Subgrid](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/css-grid-2/.
	- A look at the features coming in CSS Grids level 2, most of which revolve around Subgrid... something that is a bit too fiddly to explain in just text. But the gist is the idea of being able share the collums and/or rows of an outside grid with one of its children, letting you nest them while still keeping things in sync.
  - The most obvious use case for this is things like a row of cards that have headers and footers that you want to keep the same size even with different content, as the cards can use the parent's grid to keep in sync
- [Mac Keyboard Shortcuts Every Dev Should Know](https://dev.to/torianne02/mac-keyboard-shortcuts-every-new-dev-should-know-169l)
  - I'm a sucker for keyboard shortcuts and like trying to learn new ones. There's a few I want to get into the habit of using:
    - Find instances: select your thing then `command + D` to find each one, getting a shiny new cursor each time. You can then edit them all at once. `command + U` to unselect.
    - Moving about: `command + left/right` to go the beginning or end of the line, add shift to select as well. Do the same with `option` instead of `command` for the same thing but with words.
- [CSS Tricks: Weaving One Element Over and Under Another Element](https://css-tricks.com/weaving-one-element-over-and-under-another-element/)
  - A really smart little technique I'm not going to try to properly explain here, but is a good example of using css blend modes for unexpected purposes. It feels like a lot of fun could be had with this.
- [ECAbrams: React to Audio in AE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n87AkeEwgQg)
  - Another technical one. This explores a few different techniques for playing with using audio to key visuals, beginning with basic 'convert audio to keyframes' techniques and using expressions to build animations from that, to some more in-depth, versatile and powerful plug ins like FreqReact, Beat Edit, BeatReact and SoundKeys.


## Next week then?

Trying to get back on the wagon. There's still a lot of recording to do and I still feel pretty wiped out, but my plan is to do things nice and granular. I've also added doing 5+ minutes of intervals practice [Tenuto](https://www.musictheory.net/products/tenuto) to my daily plan. But I want to make sure I get enough rest to counteract the clocks changing, to clear my head and keep my energy up. So even if I feel a little bit wiped out still, I'm hopeful I can get somewhere.

Best of luck with whatever you're up to this week. Take care of yourselves.
