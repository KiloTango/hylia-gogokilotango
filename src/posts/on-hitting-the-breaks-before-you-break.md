While it feels super weird to be writing about this in the face of the current... everything, I started it before the news escalated and wanted to get get it off my chest anyway. So here we go. You might have noticed I kind of vanished from doing the round up posts this year, right after doing the first one. I told myself at the start of this dodecaweek to take my plans with a grain of salt and to change them if I needed to.

And apparently the change I needed to do is pitch most of those plans and goals directly into the bin.

The year started off at kind of a run, with a fair amount of away time, a fairly mad amount of recording to do (with some [very fun results](https://harmonicblend.bandcamp.com/album/sandhikala-mantradeva-vocal-soundtrack-2)) and some pretty intensive design work on top of my part time gig. All while being at the nadir of Season Adjustment Disorder Fun times, and a relentlessly awful news cycle. The work itself didn't really feel like that much, but I'd had a few brushes with the edge of burnout across the previous year that I'd convinced myself I'd totally gotten away with zero long term repercussions somehow, and meanwhile I'd been weaving myself these systems to try and keep motivated and maintain shape to my potentially mushy days (I work from home). And as someone who really enjoys learning and self improvement, I thought this stuff would carry me through the mental and emotional grind.

Until the point I noticed how much time I was spending being a non-functional bag of guilt and executive dysfunction on the sofa. How herculean a task just getting out of bed was becoming. How I was getting stuck to my office chair after work as night time fell, not finding the mental energy to go make the food I needed to have the energy to make the food I needed to have the energy to get out of that cycle. How much I was normalising everything just being too much, all of the time, and of course you're exhausted on an existential level, that's just how things are, and of course you are having trouble caring about anything any more, that's just how things are, and of course you just want it to stop but nothing stops and you can't stop, that's just how things areâ€”

And that's not how things are supposed to be.

So I pulled the goddam plug out of the wall.

Looking back at things across the last year or so, I've been doing a lot of paying lip service to the concept of rest and recovery. Some actually useful things as well, I'm a lot more conscious of the effects of proper sleep, eating sensibly, the seasons and my monthly cycles have on me, and putting stuff in place to give myself the best chance I can. But in trying to give myself these systems to _make_ myself do all the things I know put me at my best and keep pushing me forward, I wasn't actually giving myself any time to not try and be my best. Because sometimes you're not your best. Sometimes the tank is empty even if you're looking at the horizon so intently you've not noticed the blinky warning lights. Sometimes you need to just _be_ for a bit, to give yourself time to stretch and breathe. And to figure out where the metaphorical gas station is so that you can work out how you're going to get some fuel in there.

So yeah, that meant giving up what I could, and as this place was intended as a way to make myself accountable, I gave myself permission to go radio silent. Mostly to stop myself making any promises because I know what I'm like. It was the easiest and smartest source of pressure to remove so I just let it drop entirely.

When you're someone who has been working on depression, the concept of slowing down or even stopping can be absolutely terrifying. One of the concepts you're taught if you've had CBT is about action and inertia kind of being a spiral. The more you do, the more you're capable of and equally if you don't do things, it's harder to get moving. So any time you remove elements from your stack of things you're getting yourself to do, there's always that nagging doubt of "is this relapsing?", coupled with equally the scary "what if I can't make myself do things again if I let myself stop now?". But that cycle of "Do Stuff -> Able to do more stuff" only really applies to the start getting yourself moving, it's not a cycle that can maintain itself forever without the wheels catching fire. And crucially, the "Don't do stuff -> Harder to do stuff" cycle isn't absolute either. It's "harder", not "impossible". And the chances are if you're the sort of person to know about that cycle and worry about it, _you've already dragged yourself out of it before._ You can do it again. Yes, it will probably be more difficult than you'd like. But it'll be a lot easier than trying to do it while you're on fire.

So that's why there's not been anything on here for a while. I wasn't in a position I could stop absolutely everything but I cut things right down. I let myself read more fiction. I cooked a lot and tried to gently get my space back to something that wasn't doing my head in. I spent time with friends where I could. I took time to check in with how I was feeling about things, if I was giving myself what I needed, and what I was letting take up space in my head. Crucially, when I just really needed to veg out of the sofa not doing anything productive at all, I let myself do that occasionally. I let myself breathe out.

I needed that a lot more than I'd ever have dared to admit.

It's nearly time for the clocks to change, which is usually a threshold for me feeling like a functional human being. Of course, everything is an absolute mess in the outside world right now, so it feels deeply weird writing about finally getting your head slightly more together and ready to actually do some stuff when everyone else is losing their minds and everything is shutting down. But I've been psyching myself up to say something about why I've been so quiet for a while and now I actually have the energy and headspace to do it, so here we are.

I don't know if I'll do actual goals for next quarter. I'd like to keep things flexible for a bit. One foot in front of the other, one day at a time, seems to be the thing right now. But I'd like to try and use this place a little more. So we'll see how that goes, I guess.

In the mean time, please look after yourselves. Remember you don't need to have a good reason to call up a buddy and even if it's not the same as being around people in person, it can really help hear your friends voices. Someone out there might really need to hear yours. Remember you don't have to be productive in all your downtime, and that stress and anxiety burn your energy so if you're tired it's ok to rest. In defiance of everything, be kind to yourselves and to each other.
