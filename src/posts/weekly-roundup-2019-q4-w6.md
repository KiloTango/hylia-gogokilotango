## How did it go?

As mentioned last time, I decided to try and take things a little steadier this week, but some lack of sleep threw things off a bit and I'm still not quite as rested as I'd like. But trying to build things back up gently.

## Did you do the things?
- **Upskilling:** A bunch of conference videos this time. As last time I was lax on making notes, but there were some really strong ones in here.
- **Practice & Writing:** This one really wasn't as strong as I'd like.
- **Music:** Slightly surprisingly, ended up doing quite a lot of whistle practice. There's a tune I wrote that is tantalisingly annoying to play at my current skill level so I've been trying to get it under my hands so that I can share it with people.
- **Tidying, filing, email:** Little by little getting back on top of this
- **Personal work:** In another surprise, actually ended up doing some drawing for myself. That was pretty nice.


## What did you read/watch/listen to? What did you learn?

I really need to start making these notes the day I watch them. The bit of me that claims I'll be able to remember everything by the end of the week is talking total nonsense. This weeks' talks were all really quite dense as well.

- [Vitaly Friedman | Dirty Little Tricks From The Dark Corners of eCommerce | UX Special, CSS Day 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX2SRH-fg0U)
 	- A lighthearted dive into a bunch of patterns and annoyances from the E-Commerce world, including some the endearing silly little details that Smashing has incorporated into its UI along with lots of rock solid practices.
  - Get the actual final price in front of your users as soon as you can, most abandonment happens when they see the shipping costs added on.
  - Users don't like to have to click to load more things, or to see everything via infinite scroll. But somehow combining a bit of both goes down alright.
  - Something with a slightly lower review score but loads more reviews will do better than things with fewer but all good reviews. People don't trust 5 out of 5.
  - Sometimes just a padlock icon can be even more effective than an actual Norton security seals. Do you need to really remind people about security in what you're selling?
  - Please use an auto complete thing for country selectors. Most country selectors are just terrible
  - Let people confirm their email on the thank you page as that's where people slow down.
- [Steve Schoger | Refactoring UI | CSS Day 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z9rrryIOC4&t=52s).
	- This is a fantastic and dense little talk, taking use through step by step on the design decisions to move from an uninspired but functional bootstrap looking site to something much more elegant and polished. It's jammed packed with good little bits of advice and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in design who wants to up their skills
  - There's too many good things to mention in this but my favourite bits of advice were to start choosing padding by giving way way too much white space and then bringing it down rather than going from too little upwards, and that using the difference in apparent brightness of different hues can let you make more lively lighter/darker shades than just directly adjusting the brightness, by also cycling the hue (ie: making a blue lighter by bringing it towards cyan).
- [Rachel Andrew | Refactoring (the way we talk about) CSS | CSS Day 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqYWDGzhZKM)
  - This one looks at how outdated our ways of talking about CSS have become, both in that the tech itself has changed but also in our attitudes. We need to talk about css as is it today, not the woes of the past.
  - It's time we stopped describing genuine css techniques as hacks. Save those terms for things that actually _are_ hacks rather than devaluing our whole discipline by making it seem fluffy and fragile.
  - It's time to move on from the confusion of the box model, and soon we'll also be able to talk about things more clearly in terms of 'logical' inline and block directions rather than 'physical' ones, bringing clarity and flexibility to how we define the shape of our content.
- [Hakim El Hattab | Building Better Interfaces | UI Special, CSS Day 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0NtjY17v5w&t=2014s)
  - Showcases some really slick and inspiring bits of UX. There's a lot done around tying elements to the location of the action that causes them to appear, and an extremely cool use of SVG for solving letting the cursor get from a button to a popup menu without using sluggish timeouts.
- [Benjamin De Cock | Motion & Playfulness | UX Special, CSS Day 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZpTvZuysIo)
  - Another strong set of inspiring bits of UI design, in this case very animation focused. There's a lot used to build continuity of action here as well, and some very clever use of SVG to get fast loading placeholders that can then be faded into the real versions.
  - Underlines that sometimes you just have to take the time to handcraft something cool, it might take a while but so often it's the only way to get the results you need.
  - Avoid using default easings, especially 'linear'. Ease out when you bring things in, ease in and out when you move an existing thing, and be careful when using ease in to remove a thing as it can make stuff sluggish if you make the animation too slow.
  - If you can't animate all the things with transforms and opacity, consider SVG as you can use fractional pixel values there in a way some css props cannot handle, giving you much smoother animations

## This week then?

Another gentle week, with a few evenings out and friends over for music making good times at the weekend. But I also want to get back on track with my working out, sort out a little of my sleep dep and just make sure to keep things ticking over. Also to keep up with making some good, comforting healthy food. The week started with baked aubergines and it made me feel real fancy.

I hope you can find some time to make yourself something you like to fend off the gloom too.
